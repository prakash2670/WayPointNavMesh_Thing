Assignment 1: Waypoint System with Unity NavMesh and Object Spawning
Task: Develop a waypoint system using Unity's NavMesh that spawns game objects along the path at predetermined distances.
Instructions:
Setup:
Create a simple Unity scene with terrain and multiple waypoints.
Waypoint System:
Implement a system where a character can navigate to the closest waypoint using Unity's NavMesh.
The character should follow a path that adjusts dynamically if waypoints are moved.
Object Spawning:
Create a script that spawns game objects (e.g., markers, items) along the path at predetermined distances (e.g., every 1, 2, 3 meters).
Ensure that the objects are placed accurately along the path and update if the path changes.
AI Assistance:
Use of AI tools in developing the system is allowed.
Document how the AI tools helped in the development process. (Required)
